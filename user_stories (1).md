## __***Busmall startup***__

 

 1. As a startup, our client needs to take care of its expense. They are asking us to create an app that helps them to find which are the products from their catalogue most likely sell.
 2. As a seller, I need to find which products are the favorite ones. We will need the app to display aleatory images to potencial customers so that they can  click to choose their favorites.
 3. As a potencial customer, I will have a limited oportunity to click images, up to 25. We need to set the app for this limitation. 
 4. The data what our client will need is going to be:  
	 5. How many times the images were displayed.
	 6. How many times it was clicked.
	 7. What was the most clicked.
	 8. How many images did we display.



------
> **Note:**
The app must be user friendly. The app will display 3 images at a time. The same image cannot be displayed twice consecutively. The group images cannot be the same.
